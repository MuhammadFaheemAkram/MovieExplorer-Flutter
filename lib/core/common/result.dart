/// switch (await getTrendingMovies()) {
///   case Ok(:final value): show(value);
///   case Err(:final exception): showError(exception.message);
/// }
/// ```

final class const Ok<T>(final T value) extends Result<T>;

/// Failure, carrying the [exception] that explains it.
final class const Err<T>(final AppException exception) extends Result<T>;
